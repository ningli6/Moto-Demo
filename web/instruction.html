        </div>
        <h4>Specify number of channels</h4>
        <p>First, select number of channels with the dropdown button. This will specify the number of channels that the simulation will operate on. We have provided three options, you can choose to use either one, two or three channels for the simulation.</p>
        <h4>Specify the grid size</h4>
        <p>Then you need to specify grid size with the dropdown button. We implemented our map in terms of the matrix. By specifying grid size here you are actually specifying granularity of the matrix. For now we have provided three options: 0.5 km, 1 km and 5 km. For a certain area, smaller grid size means a more fine-grained underlying matrix, and more computation needed as well.</p>
        <h4>Specify analysis area and locations of Primary Users</h4> 
        <p>The next thing you need to do is to specify analysis area and Primary Users distribution for the simulation. Here are the rules to interact with the Google Map:</p>
        <div class="well">
            <p>Use the button in the upper middle area of the Google Map frame to draw a rectangle on the map. This region covered by this rectangle is the area of analysis.</p>
            <p>By clicking on the map, a location will be marked with a circle centered at that location. The marker indicates the location of the Primary User. The circle indicates the circular protection zone of the Primary User.</p>
            <p>You can either plot analysis area first or specifying markers first. But once you have analysis area ready, you must select location of Primary Users inside the region. Once you have markers ready, you must draw an analysis area that covers all the primary Users.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Choose countermeasures</h4>
        <p>Once you have set up above parameters, the simulation is actually good to go. It is a good time to specify which countermeasure to use. We have implemented four countermeasures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Additive Noise</li>
            <li>Transfiguration</li>
            <li>K-Anonymity</li>
            <li>K-Clustering</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you don't select any of them, the simulation will go with no countermeasure. For each countermeasure you select, you also need to specify countermeasure value. These values can be very different based on the nature of countermeasures.</p>
        <p>On the right part of the section you can check the <mark>Plot on Google Maps</mark> option to project probability heat map on top of the Google Map. You can also check the <mark>Include trade-off</mark> option to show the comparison between different countermeasure values for a particular countermeasure.</p>
        <h4>Specify queries</h4>
        <p>The final step is to specify method of queries and the number of queries for the simulation. Generally more queries require more time to compute but give more accurate result.</p>
        <p>We have implemented two methods of query:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Random queries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generate query locations randomly within the analysis region.</li>
            <li>Smart queries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generate query locations based on more sophisticated algorithm.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our smart query algorithm is quite computationally demanding, expect a long time for it to finish.</p>
        <h4>Specify your email</h4>
        <p>Don't forget to fill in your email address so that we can send you the simulation results via email.</p>
